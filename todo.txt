1. Continue implementing libc standard functions like printf 
so that it makes sense to debug functions like print_gdt, 
print_idt or print_pte inside kernel/gdt.h kernel/idt.h and 
kernel/paging.h respectivly. 
2. Figure out what libc functions correspond to page allocation
and use them as a launchin point to adding functions to manage
page allocation.
3. Related research on different kinds of data structures to 
store imformation about pages, page tables, and the page
directory.
4. With the memory map information from GRUB fix the GDT so
that non available memory issues a segmentation fault. This 
should be done after boot and in a way that conforms to the
information given by GRUB (not hardcoded).
5. Plan memory
